## V2 SDK for the BSC testnet

Since there isn't an official PancakeSwap on testnet and the v2 frontend swap interface code isn't published on the [PancakeSwap github](https://github.com/pancakeswap) I decided to adjust [`pancake-swap-interface-v1`](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-swap-interface-v1) for v2 routers on the BSC testnet as per [this comment on issue #365](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-swap-interface-v1/issues/365#issuecomment-845603976).

This fork requires a fork of [`cd3d-dex-libs-sdk`](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancakeswap-sdk-v2), instructions and code can at [https://github.com/ibhagwan/pancakeswap-sdk-v2](https://github.com/ibhagwan/pancakeswap-sdk-v2).

## Step 1: Build `pancakeswap-sdk-v2`

```
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancakeswap-sdk-v2
```

- Modify `FACTORY_ADDRESS` & `INIT_CODE_HASH` in `src/constants.ts`
- Modify the testnet `WBNB` at the end of `entities/token.ts`:
    ```
    [ChainId.BSCTESTNET]: new Token(
        ChainId.BSCTESTNET,
        '0xae13d989dac2f0debff460ac112a837c89baa7cd',
        18,
        'WBNB',
        'Wrapped BNB'
    )
    ```
> **Note:** if you'd like to use the default testnet router `0xD99D1c33F9fC3444f8101754aBC46c52416550D1` you can skip the editing and `git clone https://github.com/ibhagwan/pancakeswap-sdk-v2.git` instead.

Build:
```
‚ùØ yarn
‚ùØ npm run build
```

## Step 2: 

Clone and branch to the commit before V2 changes:
```
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-swap-interface-v1
‚ùØ git branch pancake_v2 0257017
‚ùØ git checkout pancake_v2
```

Create `.env` with the below contents:
```
REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL="https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545"
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID="97"
```

Modify `ROUTER_ADDRESS` in `src/constants/index.ts`

Edit the tokens you'd like to appear in the UI in `src/constants/token/pancakeswap.json` (change the token `address` and set `chainId` to 97)

Search the entire project for `'cd3d-dex-libs-sdk'` and replace with `'cd3d-dex-libs-sdk'`
> I do this with vim, search the entire project with `fzf|rg` into a quickfix list and use
> `:cdo %s/'@pancakeswap-libs\/sdk'/'@pancakeswap-libs\/sdk-v2'/g`


```
‚ùØ yarn
‚ùØ npm install ../pancakeswap-sdk-v2
‚ùØ rm -rf ./node_modules/cd3d-dex-libs-sdk
‚ùØ yarn start
